<td>The operating system must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account management functions.</td>
<td>Enterprise environments make account management challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. <p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p><p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p>A comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.<p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p><p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p>The automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.<p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p><p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p>Account management functions include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.</td>

Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. Operating systems need to track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity.

Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of information technology products that are part of the information system. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system including parameters related to meeting other security control requirements.

<td>The operating system must check the validity of all data inputs except those specifically identified by the IAM.</td>
<td>Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into data entry fields and the operating system is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated operating system behavior, potentially leading to a system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an operating system. <p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p><p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p>Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If the operating system uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.

<td>The operating system must enforce organization-defined discretionary access control policies over defined subjects and objects.</td>
<td>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user controlled file permissions.<p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p><p xmlns="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1"></p>When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.</td>
