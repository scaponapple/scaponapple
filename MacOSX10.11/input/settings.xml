  <description>These security settings for Mac OS X 10.11

  <!-- Many of the XCCDF elements used here 
       are not used in the manner originally intended by
       the XCCDF specification; 
       this is a result of the SRG-based process,

<rationale>A default screensaver must be configured for all users, as the screensaver will act as a session time-out lock for the system and must be one that conceals the contents of the screen from unauthorized users. The screensaver must not display any sensitive information or reveal the contents of the locked session screen. Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images such as patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, a clock, a battery life indicator, or a blank screen.</rationale>

If not, this is a finding.</check-content></check>
<rationale>A screensaver must be enabled and set to require a password to unlock. The timeout should be set to fifteen minutes of inactivity. This mitigates the risk that a user might forget to manually lock the screen before stepping away from the computer.<p/><p/>A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system, but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.</rationale>

<rationale>Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, increase risk and expose those systems to possible cyber attacks, so all remote access should be closely monitored and audited. Only authorized users should be permitted to remotely access DoD non-public information systems. An attacker might attempt to log in as an authorized user, through stolen credentials, unpatched exploits of the remote access service, or brute force attempts to guess a valid username and password. If a user is attempting to log in to a system from an unusual location or at an unusual time, or if there are many failed attempts, there is a possibility that the system is the target of a cyber attack. Auditing logon events mitigates this risk by recording all logon attempts, successful and unsuccessful, to the system.</rationale>

<rationale>The 'rexec' service must be disabled. The 'rexec' service does not implement crypto and has had several security vulnerabilities in the past. It is disabled by default; enabling it would increase the attack surface of the system.<p/><p/>Without confidentiality protection mechanisms, unauthorized individuals may gain access to sensitive information via a remote access session. <p/><p/>Remote access is access to DoD non-public information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. <p/> <p/>Encryption provides a means to secure the remote connection to prevent unauthorized access to the data traversing the remote access connection (e.g., RDP) thereby providing a degree of confidentiality. The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information.</rationale>

<rationale>The telnet service must be disabled, as it sends all data, including the user's password, in a clear text form that can be easily intercepted and read. Passwords need to be protected at all times and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Disabling telnet is one way to mitigate this risk. Authorized users should be instructed to use an alternate service that implements cryptography for remote access sessions, such as SSH.</rationale>

<rationale>It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives.

<rationale>The Screen Sharing feature allows remote users to view or control the desktop of the current user.

<rationale>Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts which are established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.<p/><p/>Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account which is created for use by vendors or system maintainers.<p/><p/>To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.</rationale>

While some vendors depend on this file attribute for proper operation, security problems can result if setuid is assigned to programs allowing reading and writing of files, or shell escapes, as this could lead to unprivileged users gaining privileged access to files and directories on the system.</rationale>

Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.<p/><p/>When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: <p/><p/>(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the operating system must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner. <p/><p/>(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the operating system must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.</rationale>

<rationale>Frequently, an attacker that successfully gains access to a system has only gained access to an account with limited privileges, such as a guest account or a service account. The attacker must attempt to change to another user account with normal or elevated privileges in order to proceed. Auditing successful and unsuccessful attempts to switch to another user account mitigates this risk.</rationale>
