<title>The operating system must initiate a session lock after a 15-minute period of inactivity.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>A screensaver must be enabled and set to require a password to unlock. The timeout should be set to fifteen minutes of inactivity. This mitigates the risk that a user might forget to manually lock the screen before stepping away from the computer.<p/><p/>A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system, but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.</rationale>
<check>To check if the system has a configuration profile configured to enable the screen saver after a time-out period, run the following command:<p/><p/>system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | grep idleTime<p/><p/>The check should return a value of '900' or less for idleTime. If not, this is a finding.</check>
<fixtext>This setting is enforced using a configuration profile.</fixtext>

<title>The operating system must implement DoD-approved encryption to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>The 'rexec' service must be disabled. The 'rexec' service does not implement crypto and has had several security vulnerabilities in the past. It is disabled by default; enabling it would increase the attack surface of the system.<p/><p/>Without confidentiality protection mechanisms, unauthorized individuals may gain access to sensitive information via a remote access session.<p/><p/>Remote access is access to DoD non-public information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.<p/><p/>Encryption provides a means to secure the remote connection to prevent unauthorized access to the data traversing the remote access connection (e.g., RDP) thereby providing a degree of confidentiality. The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information.</rationale>
<check>To check if the 'rexec' service is disabled, use the following command:<p/><p/>sudo launchctl print-disabled system | grep com.apple.rexecd<p/><p/>If the results do not show the following:<p/><p/>"com.apple.rexecd" =&gt; true<p/><p/>this is a finding.<p/></check>

<title>The operating system must implement cryptography to protect the integrity of remote access sessions.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>The telnet service must be disabled, as it sends all data, including the user's password, in a clear text form that can be easily intercepted and read. Passwords need to be protected at all times and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Disabling telnet is one way to mitigate this risk. Authorized users should be instructed to use an alternate service that implements cryptography for remote access sessions, such as SSH.</rationale>
<check>To check if the 'telnet' service is disabled, use the following command:<p/><p/>sudo launchctl print-disabled system | grep com.apple.telnetd<p/><p/>If the results do not show the following:<p/><p/>"com.apple.telnetd" =&gt; true<p/><p/>this is a finding.</check>

<title>The rshd service must be disabled.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.<p/><p/>Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).<p/><p/>Examples of non-essential capabilities include, but are not limited to, games, software packages, tools, and demonstration software, not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission, but cannot be disabled.<p/><p/>The 'rshd' service must be disabled.</rationale>

<title>The operating system must monitor remote access methods.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, increase risk and expose those systems to possible cyber attacks, so all remote access should be closely monitored and audited. Only authorized users should be permitted to remotely access DoD non-public information systems. An attacker might attempt to log in as an authorized user, through stolen credentials, unpatched exploits of the remote access service, or brute force attempts to guess a valid username and password. If a user is attempting to log in to a system from an unusual location or at an unusual time, or if there are many failed attempts, there is a possibility that the system is the target of a cyber attack. Auditing logon events mitigates this risk by recording all logon attempts, successful and unsuccessful, to the system.</rationale>
<check>To check to make sure the audit daemon is configured to log all login events, both local and remote, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo grep ^flags /etc/security/audit_control<p/><p/>The flag 'lo' should be included in the list of flags set. If it is not, this is a finding.</check>
<fixtext>To make sure the appropriate flags are enabled for auditing, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo sed -i.bak '/^flags/ s/$/,lo/' /etc/security/audit_control; sudo audit -s<p/><p/>A text editor may also be used to implement the required updates to the /etc/security/audit_control file.</fixtext>

<title>The operating system must automatically remove or disable temporary user accounts after 72 hours.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts must be set upon account creation.<p/><p/>Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.<p/><p/>If temporary accounts are used, the operating system must be configured to automatically terminate these types of accounts after a DoD-defined time period of 72 hours.<p/><p/>To address access requirements, many operating systems may be integrated with enterprise level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.</rationale>
<check>Password policy can be set with the pwpolicy utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set. To check if the password policy is configured to disable a temporary account after 72 hours, run the following command to output the password policy to the screen, substituting the correct user name in place of username:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy -u username getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2<p/><p/>If there is no output, and password policy is not controlled by a directory server, this is a finding.<p/><p/>Otherwise, look for the line '&lt;key&gt;policyCategoryAuthentication&lt;/key&gt;'.<p/><p/>In the array that follows, there should be a &lt;dict&gt; section that contains a check &lt;string&gt; that allows users to log in if 'policyAttributeCurrentTime' is less than the result of adding 'policyAttributeCreationTime' to 72hours (259299 seconds). The check might use a variable defined in its policyParameters section.<p/><p/>If the check does not exist or if the check adds too great an amount of time to 'policyAttributeCreationTime', this is a finding.</check>
<fixtext>This setting may be enforced using a configuration profile or by a directory server.<p/><p/>To set the password policy without a configuration profile, run the following command to save a copy of the current policy file, substituting the correct user name in place of username:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy -u username getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2 &gt; pwpolicy.plist<p/><p/>Open the resulting password policy file in a text editor.<p/><p/>If other policy settings are present, and the line &lt;key&gt;policyCategoryAuthentication&lt;/key&gt; already exists, insert the following text after the &lt;array&gt; tag that immediately follows it:<p/><p/>&lt;dict&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyContent&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;string&gt;policyAttributeCurrentTime &lt; policyAttributeCreationTime + 259299&lt;/string&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyIdentifier&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;string&gt;Disable Temporary Account&lt;/string&gt;<p/>&lt;/dict&gt;<p/><p/>At a minimum, edit the file to ensure that it contains the following text:<p/><p/>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<p/>&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;<p/>&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;<p/>&lt;dict&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyCategoryAuthentication&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;array&gt;<p/>&lt;dict&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyContent&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;string&gt;policyAttributeCurrentTime &lt; policyAttributeCreationTime + 259299&lt;/string&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyIdentifier&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;string&gt;Disable Temporary Account&lt;/string&gt;<p/>&lt;/dict&gt;<p/>&lt;/array&gt;<p/>&lt;/dict&gt;<p/>&lt;/plist&gt;<p/><p/>After saving the file and exiting to the command prompt, run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the correct user name in place of username:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy -u username setaccountpolicies pwpolicy.plist</fixtext>

<title>The operating system must be configured such that emergency administrator accounts are never automatically disabled.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts which are established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.<p/><p/>Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account which is created for use by vendors or system maintainers.<p/><p/>To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.</rationale>
<check>If an emergency account has been created on the workstation, check the expiration settings of a local account using the following command, replacing username with the correct value:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy -u username getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2<p/><p/>If there is output, ensure that the account policies do not restrict the ability to log on after a certain date or amount of time. If they do, this is a finding.</check>
<fixtext>To remove all pwpolicy settings for an emergency account, run the following command, replacing username with the correct value:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy -u username clearaccountpolicies<p/><p/>Otherwise, to change the password policy for an emergency account and only remove some policy sections, run the following command to save a copy of the current policy file for the specified username:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy -u username getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2 &gt; pwpolicy.plist<p/><p/>Open the resulting password policy file in a text editor and remove any policyContent sections that would restrict the ability to log on after a certain date or amount of time.<p/><p/>To remove the section cleanly, remove the entire text that begins with &lt;dict&gt;, contains the like &lt;key&gt;policyContent&lt;'/key&gt;, and ends with &lt;/dict&gt;.<p/><p/>After saving the file and exiting to the command prompt, run the following command to load the new policy file:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy -u username setaccountpolicies pwpolicy.plist</fixtext>

<title>Operating systems must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one numeric character be used.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.<p/><p/>Password complexity is one factor of several that determine how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.</rationale>
<check>Password policy can be set with a configuration profile or the pwpolicy utility.

If this check allows users to create passwords without at least one numeric character, or if no such check exists, this is a finding.</check>
<fixtext>This setting may be enforced using a configuration profile or by a directory server.<p/><p/>To set the password policy without a configuration profile, run the following command to save a copy of the current pwpolicy account policy file:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2 &gt; pwpolicy.plist<p/><p/>Open the generated file in a text editor.<p/><p/>If the file does not yet contain any policy settings, replace &lt;dict/&gt; with &lt;dict&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;.

<title>The operating system must prohibit password reuse for a minimum of five generations.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. If the information system or application allows the user to consecutively reuse their password when that password has exceeded its defined lifetime, the end result is a password that is not changed as per policy requirements.</rationale>
<check>To check if the password policy is configured to prevent users from reusing one of their five previously used passwords, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy getglobalpolicy | tr ' ' '\n' | grep usingHistory<p/><p/>If the result is not 'usingHistory=5', and password policy is not controlled by a directory server, this is a finding.</check>

<title>The operating system must audit the enforcement actions used to restrict access associated with changes to the system.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>By auditing access restriction enforcement, changes to application and OS configuration files can be audited. Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions, it will be difficult to identify attempted attacks and an audit trail will not be available for forensic investigation.<p/><p/>Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized changes to configuration settings. Enforcement action methods may be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file permissions (access restriction). Audit items may consist of lists of actions blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after the fact.</rationale>

<title>The operating system must enforce an account lockout time period of 15 minutes in which three consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user are made.</title>
<description></description>
<rationale>Setting a lockout time period of 15 minutes is an effective deterrent against brute forcing that also makes allowances for legitimate mistakes by users. When three invalid logon attempts are made, the account will be locked.</rationale>
<check>Password policy can be set with a configuration profile or the pwpolicy utility. If password policy is set with a configuration profile, run the following command to check if the system has the correct setting for the logon reset timer:<p/><p/>system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | grep 'minutesUntilFailedLoginReset'<p/><p/>If 'minutesUntilFailedLoginReset is not set to '15', this is a finding.<p/><p/>If password policy is set with the pwpolicy utility, the variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set. To check if the password policy is configured to disable an account for 15 minutes after 3 unsuccessful logon attempts, run the following command to output the password policy to the screen:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy getaccountpolicies<p/><p/>Look for the line '&lt;key&gt;policyCategoryAuthentication&lt;/key&gt;'. If this does not exist, and password policy is not controlled by a directory server, this is a finding.<p/><p/>In the array that follows, there should one or more &lt;dict&gt; sections that describe policy checks. One should contain a &lt;string&gt; that allows users to log on if 'policyAttributeFailedAuthentications' is less than 'policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications'. Under policyParameters, policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications should be set to 3. If 'policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications' is not set to 3, this is a finding.<p/><p/>In the same check or in another &lt;dict&gt; section, there should be a &lt;string&gt; that allows users to log on if the 'policyAttributeCurrentTime' is greater than the result of adding 15 minutes (900 seconds) to 'policyAttributeLastFailedAuthenticationTime'. The check might use a variable defined in its policyParameters section. If the check does not exist or if the check adds too great an amount of time, this is a finding.</check>
<fixtext>This setting may be enforced using a configuration profile or by a directory server.<p/><p/>The following two lines within the configuration enforce lockout expiration to 15 minutes:<p/><p/>&lt;key&gt;autoEnableInSeconds&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;integer&gt;900&lt;/integer&gt;<p/><p/>To set the password policy without a configuration profile, run the following command to save a copy of the current pwpolicy account policy file:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2 &gt; pwpolicy.plist<p/><p/>Open the generated file in a text editor and ensure it contains the following text after the opening &lt;dict&gt; tag and before the closing &lt;/dict&gt; tag.<p/><p/>Replace &lt;dict/&gt; first with &lt;dict&gt;&lt;/dict&gt; if necessary.<p/><p/>&lt;key&gt;policyCategoryAuthentication&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;array&gt;<p/>&lt;dict&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyContent&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;string&gt;(policyAttributeFailedAuthentications &lt; policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications) OR (policyAttributeCurrentTime &gt; (policyAttributeLastFailedAuthenticationTime + autoEnableInSeconds))&lt;/string&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyIdentifier&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;string&gt;Authentication Lockout&lt;/string&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyParameters&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;dict&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;autoEnableInSeconds&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;integer&gt;900&lt;/integer&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;integer&gt;3&lt;/integer&gt;<p/>&lt;/dict&gt;<p/>&lt;/dict&gt;<p/>&lt;/array&gt;<p/><p/>If the line &lt;key&gt;policyCategoryAuthentication&lt;/key&gt; already exists, the following text should be used instead and inserted after the first &lt;array&gt; tag that follows it:<p/><p/>&lt;dict&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyContent&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;string&gt;(policyAttributeFailedAuthentications &lt; policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications) OR (policyAttributeCurrentTime &gt; (policyAttributeLastFailedAuthenticationTime + autoEnableInSeconds))&lt;/string&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyIdentifier&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;string&gt;Authentication Lockout&lt;/string&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyParameters&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;dict&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;autoEnableInSeconds&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;integer&gt;900&lt;/integer&gt;<p/>&lt;key&gt;policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications&lt;/key&gt;<p/>&lt;integer&gt;3&lt;/integer&gt;<p/>&lt;/dict&gt;<p/>&lt;/dict&gt;<p/><p/>After saving the file and exiting to the command prompt, run the following command to load the new policy file:<p/><p/>sudo pwpolicy setaccountpolicies pwpolicy.plist<p/><p/>NOTE: Updates to password restrictions must be thoroughly evaluated in a test environment.
