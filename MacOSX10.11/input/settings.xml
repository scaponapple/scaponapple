<rationale>A default screensaver must be configured for all users, as the screensaver will act as a session time-out lock for the system and must be one that conceals the contents of the screen from unauthorized users. The screensaver must not display any sensitive information or reveal the contents of the locked session screen. Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images such as patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, a clock, a battery life indicator, or a blank screen.</rationale>

<rationale>A screensaver must be enabled and set to require a password to unlock. The timeout should be set to fifteen minutes of inactivity. This mitigates the risk that a user might forget to manually lock the screen before stepping away from the computer.<xhtml:p/><xhtml:p/>A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system, but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.</rationale>

<rationale>Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, increase risk and expose those systems to possible cyber attacks, so all remote access should be closely monitored and audited. Only authorized users should be permitted to remotely access DoD non-public information systems. An attacker might attempt to log in as an authorized user, through stolen credentials, unpatched exploits of the remote access service, or brute force attempts to guess a valid username and password. If a user is attempting to log in to a system from an unusual location or at an unusual time, or if there are many failed attempts, there is a possibility that the system is the target of a cyber attack. Auditing logon events mitigates this risk by recording all logon attempts, successful and unsuccessful, to the system.</rationale>

<rationale>Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts which are established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.<xhtml:p/><xhtml:p/>Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account which is created for use by vendors or system maintainers.<xhtml:p/><xhtml:p/>To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.</rationale>

<rationale>Configuration settings must be verified by a centrally managed system such as an MDM to ensure that they have not been changed. Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of information technology products that are part of the information system. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system including parameters related to meeting other security control requirements. Rather than visiting each and every system when verifying configuration changes, organizations will employ automated tools that can make changes across all systems.  This greatly increases efficiency and manageability of applications in a large scale environment.</rationale>

Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. The use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.</rationale>

<rationale>Frequently, an attacker that successfully gains access to a system has only gained access to an account with limited privileges, such as a guest account or a service account. The attacker must attempt to change to another user account with normal or elevated privileges in order to proceed. Auditing successful and unsuccessful attempts to switch to another user account mitigates this risk.</rationale>
