<description> Some security-relevant restrictions can be placed upon the user

<title>Disable Installation of Third-Party Apps</title>
<description> Unless necessary, disable <b>Allow Installing Apps</b>. This is
unusual for a general-purpose device. </description>
<rationale> While iOS includes features such as sandboxing that are designed to
prevent third-party apps from influencing the integrity of the operating
system, they do have the ability to access data stored on the device such as
Address Book, Location Data, or the Photo Library, and have the
ability to transmit this information. </rationale>

<Rule id="disable_camera"> 
<title>Disable Camera</title>

<title>Disable Screen Capture</title>
