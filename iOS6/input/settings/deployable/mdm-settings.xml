<title>Mobile Device Management</title>  
<description> Some behavior of Mobile Device Management (MDM) software can be
configured inside a configuration profile. This includes how much information
an MDM server can retrieve from a device, whether an MDM server can update
profiles remotely, whether an MDM server can remotely wipe a device, and
whether an MDM server can reset a device’s password. These settings allow for
more fine-grained adjustment between enterprise control versus user control of
a device. Some MDM products may not permit administrators to disable some of
their capability for querying devices.  Information about enterprise deployment
using MDM is available from Apple at
<b>http://www.apple.com/ipad/business/it-center/deployment-mdm.html</b>.

<title>Access Rights for Remote Administrators</title> 
<description> The following settings control what an MDM server is permitted to
query from an iOS device. For an enterprise-owned, enterprise-controlled
device, permitting the enterprise administrator to query as much information as
possible is appropriate. Some MDM products may simply include these access
rights by default and offer options to retrieve less information from the
device.  

<br />
<br />
At the same time, querying all of these types of information may not be
appropriate even for some enterprise users, and for enterprises that support
BYOD scenarios. The terms of any individual organization’s “BYOD Contract” with
their users is beyond the scope of this document. </description>

<description> In the <b>Security</b> section, set <b>Change device password</b>
to Unchecked or Checked. This entails a risk decision, though Checked is likely
to be appropriate for most scenarios. </description>
<rationale> Most enterprises are likely well-served by permitting the MDM
administrator to remotely send a change password command, in order to allow
users with forgotten passcodes to maintain access to their devices. This would
also permit an enterprise with appropriate authority, and which needed to
overcome the Data Protection feature (such as for forensics purposes) the
ability to do so.
<br />
<br />
At the same time, an attacker who has compromised communications between the
device and its MDM server (or the MDM server itself), could maliciously send a
password-change command to defeat the data-at-rest protection on the devices.
This would depend upon an attacker’s physical compromise of the device as well
as compromise of TLS communications (or the MDM server itself).

<Rule id="allow_remote_wipe">

<rationale>Permitting remote wipe allows the enterprise to remotely wipe an iOS
device in the event that it is lost or stolen.
<br />
<br />
Note also that a layered configuration profile approach which involves specific
configuration profiles permitting access to specific services (which can be
removed by an MDM server), effectively permits selective removal of access to
services (and their local data). This can provide a form of remote wipe that is
more appropriate with BYOD scenarios that are incompatible with IT staff wiping
entire devices.
