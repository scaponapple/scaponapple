<description> iOS devices support 802.1X authentication for WPA2 Enterprise
networks, and this is strongly recommended. A RADIUS server is required for
802.1X authentication and typically involves the use of public key
infrastructure. User education and training is also important, since the user
has control over the deviceâ€™s network settings. Section  contains information
for users. DoD Instruction 8420.01, available at <b>http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/842001p.pdf</b>, provides information for DoD entities regarding the configuration and deployment of WiFi networks. </description>
