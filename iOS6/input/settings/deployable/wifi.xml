<description> iOS devices support 802.1X authentication for WPA2 Enterprise
networks, and this is strongly recommended. A RADIUS server is required for
802.1X authentication and typically involves the use of public key
infrastructure. User education and training is also important, since the user
has control over the deviceâ€™s network settings. Section  contains information
for users. DoD Instruction 8420.01, available at <b>http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/842001p.pdf</b>, provides information for DoD entities regarding the configuration and deployment of WiFi networks. </description>

<title>Use WPA / WPA2 Enterprise for Wi-Fi Encryption</title>           
<description> Using <b>WPA / WPA2 Enterprise</b> with <b>TLS</b> for
authentication is recommended. If TLS support is not available, <b>PEAP</b> is
the next best choice for authentication. All other authentication protocols are
not recommended. </description> 
<rationale> Use <b>WPA / WPA2</b> if authentication support is not available.
Proxy servers can be configured with WiFi as another layer for providing
control of the connection. </rationale>
