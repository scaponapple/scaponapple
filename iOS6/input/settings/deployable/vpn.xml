<title>VPN</title> 
<description> VPN connectivity obviously depends on an enterprise’s available
infrastructure, but VPNs which use IPsec are preferred. Several SSL VPNs are
also supported by iOS. Actual VPNs are preferred over SSL VPNs as they are
designed to protect systemwide network communications. Note, however, that at
this time iOS VPNs cannot be configured to route all traffic through a VPN, and
operate in split tunnel mode. This behavior occurs even if <b>Send All
Traffic</b> is selected as part of any VPN’s configuration. </description>

<title>Select IPsec (Cisco) or L2TP for Use as VPN</title>          
<description> Select <b>IPsec (Cisco)</b> or <b>L2TP</b> (which also uses
IPsec) for use as the Connection Type if possible. Use of hardware tokens is
generally preferred over passwords for user authentication. </description>
