<title>Configuration Deployment</title>
<description>This chapter presents information about creating and deploying
settings to iOS devices, which are generally contained in configuration
profiles. Configuration profiles are simply XML files that conform to Apple's
XML DTD and the plist format. Additional information is available at

<title>Nature of Configuration Profiles</title>
<description>Understand that a user who controls an iOS device can opt to erase
the device, which erases all data from the device including any configuration
profiles. Understand also that users can typically append further restrictive
settings, as well as services, onto the device, even in the presence of a
configuration profile.  Configuration Profile settings enforcement on the iOS
devices are cumulative indicating that they can further restrict existing
settings when applied.
<br />
<br />
iOS configuration profiles specify a collection of settings that can control
some security-relevant behavior of an iOS device, but are not designed to
provide an enterprise with total, arbitrary control over the user's device.
<br />
<br />
A "carrot and stick" approach can be employed to avoid tempting users to remove
a configuration profile (either directly or via device reset). Bind "carrots"
(such as credentials needed for enterprise access) to "sticks" (such as a
passcode policy) in a single configuration profile. Removing a configuration
profile implies that credentials necessary for accessing enterprise services
(such as VPN certificates or e-mail accounts) would also be lost, and thus deny
the user such services. Also in this case, MDM software would become unable to
query the device and the enterprise would be alerted as to the device's
unmanaged status.</description>
