<description>The operating system must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account management functions.</description>
<rationale>Enterprise environments make account management challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. <p/><p/>A comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.<p/><p/>The automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.<p/><p/>Account management functions include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.</rationale>

<description>The operating system must automatically disable accounts after a 35 day period of account inactivity.</description>
<rationale>Attackers that are able to exploit an inactive account can potentially obtain and maintain undetected access to an application. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. Operating systems need to track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be hijacked, leading to a data compromise.<p/><p/>This policy does not apply to either emergency accounts or infrequently used accounts. Infrequently used accounts are local login administrator accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available. Emergency accounts are administrator accounts created in response to crisis situations.</rationale>

<title>Apply Configuration Settings With a Configuration Profile</title>
<description>The operating system must employ automated mechanisms to centrally verify configuration settings.</description>
<rationale>Configuration settings must be verified by a centrally managed system such as an MDM to ensure that they have not been changed. Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of information technology products that are part of the information system. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system including parameters related to meeting other security control requirements. Rather than visiting each and every system when verifying configuration changes, organizations will employ automated tools that can make changes across all systems.  This greatly increases efficiency and manageability of applications in a large scale environment.</rationale>

<description>The operating system must retain the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on for further access.</description>
<rationale>The banner must be acknowledged by the user prior to allowing the user access to the operating system. This provides assurance that the user has seen the message and accepted the conditions for access. If the consent banner is not acknowledged by the user, DoD will not be in compliance with system use notifications required by law. <p/><p/>To establish acceptance of the application usage policy, a click-through banner at system logon is required. The system must prevent further activity until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on a box indicating "OK".</rationale>

<title>Audit Account Creation</title>
<description>The operating system must automatically audit account creation.</description>
<rationale>Once an attacker establishes initial access to a system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent method of re-establishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to create a new account. Auditing of account creation mitigates this risk.<p/><p/>To address access requirements, many operating systems may be integrated with enterprise level authentication/access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.</rationale>
<check>In order to view the currently configured flags for the audit daemon, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo grep ^flags /etc/security/audit_control<p/><p/>The account creation events are logged by way of the 'ad' flag.

<title>Audit Account Creation, Modification, and Deletion</title>
<description>The operating system must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events.</description>
<rationale>Account creations and account modfications, such as disablement and termination, can all be signs of an intrusion and should be audited. Once an attacker establishes access to a system, the attacker may attempt to create an account to reestablish access at a later time. The attacker may also attempt to modify accounts in an attempt to change an existing account's privileges or disable or delete accounts in a denial-of-service attack. Auditing of account creation, modification, disabling, and termination events mitigates this risk.</rationale>
<check>In order to view the currently configured flags for the audit daemon, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo grep ^flags /etc/security/audit_control<p/><p/>Privileged access, including the creation, modification, and deletion of local user accounts, is logged via the 'ad' flag.

<title>Audit All Logon Events</title>
<description>The operating system must monitor remote access methods.</description>
<rationale>Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, increase risk and expose those systems to possible cyber attacks, so all remote access should be closely monitored and audited. Only authorized users should be permitted to remotely access DoD non-public information systems. An attacker might attempt to log in as an authorized user, through stolen credentials, unpatched exploits of the remote access service, or brute force attempts to guess a valid username and password. If a user is attempting to log in to a system from an unusual location or at an unusual time, or if there are many failed attempts, there is a possibility that the system is the target of a cyber attack. Auditing logon events mitigates this risk by recording all logon attempts, successful and unsuccessful, to the system.</rationale>
<check>To check to make sure the audit daemon is configured to log all login events, both local and remote, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo grep ^flags /etc/security/audit_control<p/><p/>The flag 'lo' should be included in the list of flags set. If it is not, this is a finding.</check>

<title>Audit Kernel Module Loading and Unloading</title>
<description>The operating system must generate audit records for all kernel module load, unload, and restart actions, and also for all program initiations.</description>
<rationale>Kernel modules, called kernel extensions in Mac OS X, are compiled segments of code that are dynamically loaded into the kernel as required to support specific pieces of hardware or functionality. Privileged users are permitted to load or unload kernel extensions manually. An attacker might attempt to load a kernel extension that is known to be insecure to increase the attack surface of the system, or a user might plug in an unauthorized device that then triggers a kernel extension to be loaded. Auditing administrative actions, which include the loading or unloading of kernel extensions, mitigates this risk.</rationale>
<check>In order to view the currently configured flags for the audit daemon, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo grep ^flags /etc/security/audit_control<p/><p/>Privileged access, including administrative use of the command line tools kextload and kextunload, is logged via the 'ad' flag.  If 'ad' is not listed in the result of the check, this is a finding.</check>
<fixtext>To make sure the appropriate flags are enabled for auditing, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo sed -i.bak '/^flags/ s/$/,ad/' /etc/security/audit_control; sudo audit -s<p/><p/>You may also edit the /etc/security/audit_control file using a text editor to define the flags your organization requires for auditing.</fixtext>

<description>The operating system must isolate security functions from non-security functions.</description>
<rationale>An isolation boundary provides access control and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform security functions. <p/><p/>Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from non-security functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk, and address space protections that protect executing code. <p/><p/>Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries. Operating systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities.</rationale>

<description>The operating system must check the validity of all data inputs except those specifically identified by the IAM.</description>
<rationale>Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into data entry fields and the operating system is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated operating system behavior, potentially leading to a system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an operating system. <p/><p/>Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If the operating system uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks.</rationale>

<rationale>Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. <p/><p/>Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. <p/><p/>Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.<p/><p/>This capability is typically reserved for specific operating system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance.</rationale>

<description>The operating system must enforce organization-defined discretionary access control policies over defined subjects and objects.</description>
<rationale>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user controlled file permissions.<p/><p/>When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.</rationale>

<rationale>If authorized individuals do not have the ability to modify auditing parameters in response to a changing threat environment, the organization may not be able to effectively respond, and important forensic information may be lost.<p/><p/>This requirement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example, near real time, within minutes, or within hours.</rationale>

<description>The operating system must prevent the installation of patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components without verification they have been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.</description>
<rationale>Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. <p/><p/>Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization. <p/><p/>Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement The operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved CA.</rationale>

<description>The operating system must prevent program execution in accordance with organization-defined policies regarding software program usage and restrictions and/or rules authorizing the terms and conditions of software program usage.</description>
<rationale>Control of program execution is a mechanism used to prevent execution of unauthorized programs. Some operating systems may provide a capability that runs counter to the mission or provides users with functionality that exceeds mission requirements. This includes functions and services installed at the operating system level. <p/><p/>Some of the programs, installed by default, may be harmful or may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Removal of executable programs is not always possible; therefore, establishing a method of preventing program execution is critical to maintaining a secure system baseline.<p/><p/>Methods for complying with this requirement include restricting execution of programs in certain environments, while preventing execution in other environments; or limiting execution of certain program functionality based on organizationally defined criteria (e.g., privileges, subnets, sandboxed environments, or roles).</rationale>

<description>The operating system must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information and/or detect changes to information during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards, such as, at a minimum, a Protected Distribution System (PDS).</description>
<rationale>Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which have common application in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. <p/><p/>Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. When transmitting data, operating systems need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms such as TLS, SSL VPNs, or IPSEC.<p/><p/>Alternative physical protection measures include PDS. PDSs are used to transmit unencrypted classified National Security Information (NSI) through an area of lesser classification or control. Since the classified NSI is unencrypted, the PDS must provide adequate electrical, electromagnetic, and physical safeguards to deter exploitation.</rationale>

<description>The operating system must be configured such that emergency administrator accounts are disabled after 72 hours.</description>
<rationale>Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts which are established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability. <p/><p/>Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local login accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account which is created for use by vendors or system maintainers.<p/><p/>To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.</rationale>

<description>The operating system must protect the confidentiality and integrity of all information at rest.</description>
<rationale>FileVault Disk Encryption must be enabled. By encrypting the system hard drive, the confidentiality and integrity of any data stored on the system is ensured.<p/><p/>Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive and tape drive) within an organizational information system. Mobile devices, laptops, desktops, and storage devices can be either lost or stolen, and the contents of their data storage (e.g., hard drives and non-volatile memory) can be read, copied, or altered. FileVault Disk Encryption mitigates this risk.</rationale>

<title>Validate Certificate Trust Chains</title>
<description>The operating system, for PKI-based authentication, must validate certificates by constructing a certification path (which includes status information) to an accepted trust anchor.</description>
<rationale>Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. A setting of Best Attempt for OCSP and CRL verification (OCSPStyle and CRLStyle) will ensure that certificates will pass unless the server returns with information that the certificate is bad. A setting of true for OCSPSufficientPerCert and CRLSufficientPerCert will ensure that either OCSP or CRL verification will be sufficient to verify a certificate. A setting of OCSP for Priority (RevocationFirst) will ensure that the OCSP verification will be tried first before attempting CRL verification.<p/><p/>A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. <p/><p/>When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA. <p/><p/>This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.</rationale>
<check>The OCSPStyle option must be set correctly.

<title>Verify Default File Permissions</title>
<description>The operating system must limit privileges to change software resident within software libraries.</description>
<rationale>File permissions should be compared against the default set of permissions that were set at the time of the initial install. Changes to default file permissions can make the system less secure and disrupt the functionality of installed applications. Unless changes are required to harden a system, the default permissions should be kept. If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process. Verifying that permissions remain unchanged mitigates this risk.<p/><p/>This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals shall be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.</rationale>
<check>To check the permissions and ownership of the system files and make sure they haven't changed from the original installation, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo diskutil verifyPermissions /<p/><p/>Any results indicating User/Group/Permissions differ is a finding.</check>
<fixtext>To correct ownership and permissions of files found in the check, run the following command:<p/><p/>sudo diskutil repairPermissions /</fixtext>
