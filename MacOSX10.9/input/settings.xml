    <description>The operating system must provide automated
    mechanisms for supporting account management
    functions.</description>
    <rationale>Enterprise environments make account management
    challenging and complex. A manual process for account
    management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or
    other error. A comprehensive account management process that
    includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as
    requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed.
    Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to
    take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive,
    suspended or terminated or by disabling accounts located in
    non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This
    requirement applies to all account types, including
    individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous,
    emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and
    service. The automated mechanisms may reside within the
    operating system itself or may be offered by other
    infrastructure providing automated account management
    capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be comprised of
    differing technologies that when placed together contain an
    overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's
    automated account management requirements. Account management
    functions include: assignment of group or role membership;
    identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations
    (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination;
    and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can
    include, for example: using email or text messaging to
    automatically notify account managers when users are terminated
    or transferred; using the information system to monitor account
    usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report
    atypical system account usage.</rationale>

    <title>Disable Expired User Accounts</title>
    <description>The operating system must automatically remove or
    disable temporary user accounts after 72 hours.</description>
    <rationale>If temporary user accounts remain active when no
    longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be
    used to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk,
    automated termination of all temporary accounts must be set
    upon account creation. Temporary accounts are established as
    part of normal account activation procedures when there is a
    need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy
    in account activation. If temporary accounts are used, the
    operating system must be configured to automatically terminate
    these types of accounts after a DoD-defined time period of 72
    hours. To address access requirements, many operating systems
    may be integrated with enterprise level authentication/access
    mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy
    requirements.</rationale>
    <check>If a temporary user has been created on the workstation,
    you can check the expiration settings using the following
    command: sudo pwpolicy -u &lt;username&gt; get-effective-policy

    <description>The operating system must automatically disable
    accounts after a 35 day period of account
    inactivity.</description>
    <rationale>Attackers that are able to exploit an inactive
    account can potentially obtain and maintain undetected access
    to an application. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice
    if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained.
    Operating systems need to track periods of user inactivity and
    disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process
    greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be hijacked,
    leading to a data compromise. This policy does not apply to
    either emergency accounts or infrequently used accounts.
    Infrequently used accounts are local login administrator
    accounts used by system administrators when network or normal
    logon/access is not available. Emergency accounts are
    administrator accounts created in response to crisis
    situations.</rationale>

    <title>Audit Account Creation</title>

    <rationale>Once an attacker establishes initial access to a
    system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent
    method of re-establishing access. One way to accomplish this is
    for the attacker to simply create a new account. Auditing of
    account creation mitigates this risk. To address access
    requirements, many operating systems may be integrated with
    enterprise level authentication/access/auditing mechanisms that
    meet or exceed access control policy requirements.</rationale>

    <rationale>To assure individual accountability and prevent
    unauthorized access, organizational users shall be individually
    identified and authenticated. A group authenticator is a
    generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a group
    authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual
    users. Examples of the group authenticator is the UNIX OS
    "Root" user account, the Windows "Administrator" account, the
    "sa" account, or a "helpdesk" account. For example, the UNIX
    and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user' capability
    allowing users to authenticate with their individual
    credentials and, when needed, 'switch' to the administrator
    role. This method provides for unique individual authentication
    prior to using a group authenticator. Users (and any processes
    acting on behalf of users) need to be uniquely identified and
    authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses
    explicitly identified and documented by the organization which
    outlines specific user actions that can be performed on the
    operating system without identification or authentication.
    Requiring individuals to be authenticated with an individual
    authenticator prior to using a group authenticator allows for
    traceability of actions, as well as, adds an additional level

    risk of data loss and data compromise. An organizational
    assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated

    Organizations need to document in policy and procedures the

    separation (i.e., separation of security functions from
    non-security functions) in a number of ways, including through
    the provision of security kernels via processor rings or
    processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function
    isolation is often achieved through file system protections
    that serve to protect the code on disk, and address space
    protections that protect executing code. Developers and
    implementers can increase the assurance in security functions
    by employing well-defined security policy models; structured,
    disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development
    techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles.
    Implementation may include isolation of memory space and

    mitigates the risk of information, including encrypted
    representations of information, produced by the actions of

    an information technology product, but it can also apply to the
    configuration of particular information system components that
    are, or use, such products. This can be verified by
    acceptance/validation processes in DoD or other government

    <rationale>DoS is a condition where a resource is not available

    or external adversaries that have successfully breached the
    information system and are using the system as a platform to
    launch cyber attacks on third parties. Maintaining least
    privilege restricts users to those functions they require and
    reduces the possibility that they will misuse other functions.
    Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a
    bare minimum may reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS
    attacks. The methods employed to counter this risk will be

    <description>The operating system must terminate all network

    (privileged sessions), the session must be terminated after 10
    minutes of inactivity; and for user sessions (non-privileged
    session), the session must be terminated after 15 minutes of
    inactivity, except to fulfill documented and validated mission

    period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized
    personnel to take control of a management session enabled on

    addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up
    resources committed by the managed network element. Terminating
    network connections associated with communications sessions
    includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP
    address/port pairs at the operating system level, and
    de-allocating networking assignments at the application level
    if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating
    system level network connection. This does not mean that the

    is unprepared to process that data. This results in
    unanticipated operating system behavior, potentially leading to
    a system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary
    methods employed when attempting to compromise an operating
    system. Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information
    system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range,
    and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified
    definitions for format and content. Software typically follows
    well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e.,
    commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or
    system components. Structured messages can contain raw or
    unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control
    information. If the operating system uses attacker-supplied
    inputs to construct structured messages without properly
    encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert
    malicious commands or special characters that can cause the
    data to be interpreted as control information or metadata.
    Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted
    output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret
    the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to
    interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally
    interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure
    accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks.</rationale>

    <description>The operating system must enforce
    organization-defined discretionary access control policies over
    defined subjects and objects.</description>
    <rationale>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the
    notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and
    therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to
    access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write).
    Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the
    object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the
    owner to determine who will have access to objects they
    control. An example of DAC includes user controlled file
    permissions. When discretionary access control policies are
    implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what
    actions they can take with information for which they have
    already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been
    granted access to information are not prevented from passing
    (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the
    information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is
    constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control
    policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous
    constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access
    Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing
    information to another subject operating at a different
    sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass
    the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.
    The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once
    the information is passed outside of the control of the
    information system, additional means may be required to ensure

    information system account with authorizations of a privileged
    user. Remote access is access to DoD non-public information

    <description>The operating system must install
    security-relevant firmware updates within the time period
    directed by an authoritative source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and
    STIGs).</description>
    <rationale>Security flaws with firmware are discovered daily.
    Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to
    address newly discovered security vulnerabilities.
    Organizations (including any contractor to the organization)
    are required to promptly install security-relevant firmware
    updates. Flaws discovered during security assessments,
    continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or
    information system error handling must also be addressed
    expeditiously. Organization-defined time periods for updating
    security-relevant firmware may vary based on a variety of
    factors including, for example, the security category of the
    information system or the criticality of the update (i.e.,
    severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).
    Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary.
    Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch
    management process will also vary. This means that the time
    period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames
    for application of security-relevant firmware updates may be
    dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability
    Management (IAVM) process. The application will be configured
    to check for and install security-relevant firmware updates
    within an identified time period from the availability of the
    update. The specific time period will be defined by an
    authoritative source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and
    STIGs).</rationale>

    compromise are detected: real-time intrusion detection; threats
    identified by authoritative sources (e.g., CTOs); and Category
    I, II, IV, and VII incidents in accordance with CJCSM
    6510.01B.</description>
    <rationale>When a security event occurs, the application that
    has detected the event must immediately notify the appropriate
    support personnel so they can respond appropriately. Alerts may
    be generated from a variety of sources, including, audit
    records or inputs from malicious code protection mechanisms,
    intrusion detection, or prevention mechanisms. Alerts may be
    transmitted, for example, telephonically, by electronic mail
    messages, or by text messaging. Individuals designated by the
    local organization to receive alerts may include, for example,
    system administrators, mission/business owners, or system
    owners. IOCs are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are
    identified on organizational information systems (at the host
    or network level). IOCs provide organizations with valuable
    information on objects or information systems that have been
    compromised. These indicators reflect the occurrence of a
    compromise or a potential compromise. This requirement applies
    when the functionality is fully integrated into the operating
    system and not provided via a separate application, such as
    mobile operating systems.</rationale>

    parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or
    firmware components of the system that affect the security
    posture and/or functionality of the system. Security-related
    parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of
    the system, including the parameters required to satisfy other
    security control requirements. Security-related parameters
    include, for example: registry settings; account, file,
    directory permission settings; and settings for functions,

    <title>Apply Settings with a Configuration Profile</title>
    <description>The operating system must employ automated
    mechanisms to centrally manage configuration
    settings.</description>
    <rationale>Configuration settings are the configurable
    security-related parameters of information technology products
    that are part of the information system. Security-related
    parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of
    the system including parameters related to meeting other
    security control requirements. Security-related parameters
    include, for example, registry settings; account, file, and
    directory settings (i.e., permissions); and settings for
    services, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Rather than
    visiting each system when making configuration changes,
    organizations must employ automated tools that can make changes
    across all systems. This greatly increases efficiency and
    manageability of applications in a large scale
    environment.</rationale>

    <title>Use a DoD-Approved Proxy Server</title>
    <description>DoD proxies must be configured on all active

    <rationale>A proxy server is designed to hide the identity of
    the client when making a connection to a server on the outside
    of its network. This prevents any hackers on the outside of
    learning IP addresses within the private network. With a proxy
    acting as the mediator, the client does not interact directly
    with the servers it is connecting to; the proxy server is in
    the middle handling both sides of the session.</rationale>

    interface, run the following command: networksetup

    information requires the activity be audited by the
    organization. Any operating system providing remote access must
    support organizational requirements to audit access or
